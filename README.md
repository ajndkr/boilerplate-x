# Boilerplate-X - Create GitHub Project Boilerplate in Minutes!

Boilerplate-X is a chatGPT-powered solution to create GitHub project boilerplate for any programming language in just a few minutes. Have an idea? Turn it into a fully functional repository with Boilerplate-X!

> DISCLAIMER! This project is highly experimental and is not ready for production use. Use at your own risk!

## Why do I need this?

Starting a new project can be challenging, especially when it comes to writing basic, repetitive code. While there are many cookiecutter packages that help create an outline for your code, they aren't always tailored to your specific needs. Boilerplate-X, however, utilizes chatGPT to generate not only the foundational code like a cookiecutter but also actual code. This allows you to focus on developing unique features instead of spending hours setting up your repository.
