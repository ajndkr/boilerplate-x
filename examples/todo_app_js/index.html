This is the basic structure of our Todo App. We have an HTML file that contains
the basic structure of our app. We have a form that allows users to add new
todos, and an unordered list that displays all the todos. We also have a script
tag that links to our app.js file, which will contain the logic for our app. We
have also linked our style.css file to our HTML file to add some basic styling
to our app.
